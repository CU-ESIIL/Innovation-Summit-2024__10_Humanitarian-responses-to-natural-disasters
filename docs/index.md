# Group 10 -- Humanitarian responses to natural disasters

!!! Success "Provocative question"

    How can real-time data inform humanitarian responses to natural disasters?


Project Name: Big Disaster|Localized Action|(Big Data 9-1-1)

Project Question: How can we use big data to inform more comprehensive localized disaster response?

Datasets: 

•	Community Profile
    
    o	Infrastructure
    o	Land use
    o	Demographics + Vulnerability

•	Hazard/Environmental Data
    
    o	Weather data
    o	Fuel Condition
    o	Topography


•	Near real time data sources
    
    o	Remote sensing
    o	Social media
    o	Incident reporting


•	What worked well for your team?

    o	Whiteboard brainstorming
    o	Having some facilitator help (Max, Ty, and Lise) SME expertise
    o	Focusing in on an idea by detailed discussion
    o	Team size being smaller


•	What’s one thing you would change?

    o	One thing that could help in the future, is having a location where participants can identify certain facilitators with subject matter expertise to aid if a group    gets stuck.  


•	Did we have an “ah-ha” moment?

    o	Not too much but focusing on a smaller more manageable task, and still ideate on the future state real time analysis. 


•	Did we experience the groan zone?

    o	With a smaller group of 4 people it allows for less time in the groan zone and easier understanding of the problem. We started out with way too large of a scope, and with a smaller group it allowed us to narrow that scope into a manageable chunk.
